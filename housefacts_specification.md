# Housefacts Data Specification

## Format and Frequency

* All files in an OHHS feed should be consolidated in a single ZIP file - YYYYMMDD_name.zip
* All files in an OHHS feed must be saved as comma-delimited text, except the optional shapefile of parcels/lots with unique identifiers.
* The first line of each file must contain field names. Field names for each file are defined below under the ‘Files’ heading.
* All field names are case-sensitive.
* Field values may not contain tabs, carriage returns or new lines.
* Field values that categorize by type should contain a finite and standardized list of category descriptors with identical spelling, punctuation, capitalization and phrasing for all values in the same category.
* Field values that contain quotation marks or commas must be enclosed within quotation marks. In addition, each quotation mark in the field value must be preceded with a quotation mark. This is consistent with the manner in which Microsoft Excel outputs comma-delimited (CSV) files. For more information on the CSV file format, see http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180.
* The following example demonstrates how a field value would appear in a comma-delimited file:
* Original field value: Contains "quotes", commas and text
* Field value in CSV file: "Contains ""quotes"", commas and text"
* Field values must not contain HTML tags, comments, escape sequences, or anything else designed to break or confuse our computers.
* Remove any extra spaces between fields or field names. Many parsers consider the spaces to be part of the value, which may cause errors.
* Each line must end with a CRLF or LF linebreak character.
* Files should be encoded in UTF-8 to support all Unicode characters. Files that include the Unicode byte-order mark (BOM) character are acceptable.
* Files must be provided in a single .zip archive with flat hierarchy.
* Files should be updated weekly to reflect current inspection results.

## Files
